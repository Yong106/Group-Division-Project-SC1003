# Group-Division-Project-SC1003
Academic Project for NTU SC1003

A Python program developed to divide students into balanced groups based on CGPA, gender, and school. The algorithm uses a greedy approach initially, and further optimizes the grouping using an evolutionary algorithm. The program also features a user-friendly graphical interface to configure settings and review the group allocations.

## Features

- **Greedy Algorithm**: Initially divides students into groups based on key factors such as CGPA, gender, and school.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Optimizes the groupings to achieve a more balanced result by adjusting group compositions iteratively.
- **GUI**: A graphical user interface that allows users to configure settings and view the results.
- **Customizable**: Users can adjust parameters for grouping and review final allocations through the GUI.
